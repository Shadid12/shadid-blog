You already know JavaScript, you have been coding in JS for a while. You have heard of JavaScript’s weird parts and you have used JavaScript in both front (React.js Angular or Vue.js) and back end with Node.js.. Sounds like you ? Well now you want to take your understanding of JS to a next level. You want to know what’s happening underneath the hood, you want to learn how the single threaded system handles concurrency in JS, how the compilers work, and how JS runtimes like v8 is revolutionizing modern web applications. So where do you start ?

I have stumbled upon the same questions over and over. Finally I have compiled a list of useful topics and resources that helped me further my knowledge of JavaScript as well as modern web application. Below I have listed the main topics that I felt are absolutely necessary. I have also listed some helpful resources that summarize the subject but feel free to research more and dig deeper.

### 1. Event Loop and Concurrency

Know how the Event loop handles concurrency in javascript. This is a crucial topic to understand. If you don’t understand how the event loop works chances are you are still a junior developer, just kidding ;)

Here are couple resources that describe event loop and concurrency handling in javascript

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop

It is always a good idea to learn about the non blocking asynchronous I/O of node.js. Here’s a stack overflow post that I found extremely helpful

### 2. JIT (Just In Time Compilers)
This is a broad but useful topic while you are building applications to scale. Learn about the various runtimes of JavaScript especially V8. You will be able to significantly optimize your application (especially if you are using Nodejs in the backend) once you have learned how JavaScript runtimes work. Here’s a very interesting article that I found about the common performance pitfalls of Node.js.

This will also give you a more lower level understanding of Nodejs.

### 3. Closure
Closure is a popular topic in JavaScript. It has gained significant popularity now that other programming languages such as Python are adopting it. Here’s a free code camp article about closures.
